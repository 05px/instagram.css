# Instagram.css

Instagram.css - Pure CSS Instagram filters. You can add all these Instagram-like filters to your photos with using CSS only. Thanks to the [CSSgram](https://github.com/una/CSSgram) for inspiration.

## What's next

- Add more Instagram filters

## Getting started

Download the compiled and minified [Instagram.css files](https://github.com/picturepan2/instagram.css). Include `instagram.css` located in `/dist` in your website or Web app &lt;head&gt; part.

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/instagram.css">`

Go to [Demo page](https://picturepan2.github.io/instagram.css/) to copy the HTML source code and paste it to anywhere you want. All filters use the same HTML structure with different `filter-[filter-name]` classes.


## Custom

You can custom Instagram.css by modifing SASS `.scss` files located in `src` folder.

## Browser support

Devices.css uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make most styles compatible with earlier browsers. For best compatibility, these browsers are recommended:

- Chrome (18+)
- Microsoft Edge (13+)
- Firefox (35+)
- Safari (6+)
- Opera (15+)
